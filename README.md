# AWS in Action 

This repository organizes hands-on projects and notes into focused sections covering key AWS services, and real-world usage. Each section maps to a correspoinding project folder with working examples, deployment steps, and best practices. 

## AWS Lambda (aws-lambda/)

Explore AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service that runs code without provisioning or managing servers.

This section includes:
- Fundamentals of Lambda functions
- Event source integrations (S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB Streams, Event Bridge)
- IAM roles and permission models
- Pricing model and service restrictions
- Lambda networking (public and VPC access)
- Handling concurrency (reserved and provisioned)
- Packaging Lambda functions with container images.

Hands-on projects walk through setting up basic functions, configuring triggers, securing Lambda executions, optimizing performance, and deploying containerized functions.
